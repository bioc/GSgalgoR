\title{Harmonic mean of the distance between consecutive groups}
\usage{
cDist(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of length > 1}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 1. The function computes the Harmonic mean of the differences between consecutive groups multiplied by the number of comparisons
This function is used inside 'fitness' function.
}
\description{
Implements the harmonic mean of the distance between consecutive groups multiplied by the number of comparisons: \eqn{cDist = [n/ (1/x1-x2 + 1/x2-x3 + 1/x3-x4 +...1/xn-1 - xn)] * n-1}
}
\examples{
V <- c(4.5,3,7,11)
cDist(V)
}
