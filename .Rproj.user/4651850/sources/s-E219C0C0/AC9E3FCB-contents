\title{Harmonic mean}
\usage{
hmean(a)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{a numeric vector of length > 1}
}
\value{
returns the harmonic mean of the values in \code{a}
}
\description{
The harmonic mean can be expressed as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of a given set of observations.  Since the harmonic mean of a list of numbers tends strongly toward the least elements of the list, it tends (compared to the arithmetic mean) to mitigate the impact of large outliers and aggravate the impact of small ones.

\examples{
x= rnorm(5,0,1) #five random numbers from the normal distribution
x= c(x,20) #add outlier
hmean(x)
