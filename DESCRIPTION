Title: An evolutionary Algorithm for the Identification and Study of Prognostic Gene Expression Signatures in Cancer
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Martin Guerrero, Carlos Catania

Description: a multi-objective optimization algorithm for disease subtype discovery based on a 
    non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The galgo framework combines the advantages of 
    clustering algorithms for grouping heterogeneous omics data and the searching properties of genetic 
    algorithms for feature selection and optimal number of clusters determination to find features that 
    maximize the survival difference between subtypes while keeping cluster consistency high.
